# What is the Knapsack problem?

The Knapsack problem goes as follows:

> Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

My goal is to try a bunch of different methods of solving this problem with Python. The goal is to be as efficient as possible. Every solution file will have a comment explaining what exactly it is and how it functions.

# Why?

This is an exercise to help me learn more about dynamic programming, as it is a skill I will be needing in my studies and in my future field of work. 

# Why so many variables?

One of my objectives with this repo is to make the code in it understandable upon first read, therefore, I chose to give names to most complex expressions to make the code as readable as possible. This may not be very memory-efficient and will require more lines of code, but does make the program more readable and has a near zero, easily negligable impact on time complexity. It also helps with keeping lines of code below the 88 character limit recommended by Python.
