# What is the Knapsack problem?

The Knapsack problem goes as follows:

> Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

My goal is to try a bunch of different methods of solving this problem with Python. The goal is to be as efficient as possible. Every solution file will have a comment explaining what exactly it is and how it functions.
