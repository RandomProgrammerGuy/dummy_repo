# Numpy Weather

This project is a dummy project to help me familiarize myself with NumPy.

For this project, I use Numpy to analyze weather data in the town of Cary, North Carolina, United States. The weather data I used was provided by the Town of Cary and can be found under (this URL)[https://data.townofcary.org/explore/dataset/rdu-weather-history/information/]. It is also available on (data.gov)[https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/local-weather-archive]. The Dataset is under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
